A collaborative game is a type of game where all players win by keeping each other's interests in mind. It is a way of working that is illustrated by Trisha Ratliff in her guidebook, Innovation as a Collaborative Game.

It involves three key players: the user, creator, and investor, all working directly together. The product user defines the problem and provides feedback, the investor controls the money and expects a benefit, and the creator designs, develops, and delivers the solution. By understanding the hopes and needs of each of the key players, they can all win.

The goal of a collaborative game is to reduce emphasis on competition and increase emphasis on the dynamic of play that leads all players to benefiting. In a collaborative game, three key players are identified: the user, creator, and investor. All three players work directly together to solve a challenge, and they must establish a pattern of working on experiments together that are psychologically safe. Approaches such as DevOps, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, and Agile are all approaches that implicitly gain from a collaborative gaming mindset.
