> how does a collaborative game work?

A collaborative game is a type of game where all players win by keeping each
other's interests in mind. It is a way of working that is illustrated by Trisha
Ratliff in her guidebook, Innovation as a Collaborative Game. The goal of a
collaborative game is to reduce emphasis on competition and increase emphasis on
the dynamic of play that leads all players to benefiting. In a collaborative
game, three key players are identified: the user, creator, and investor. All
three players work directly together to solve a challenge, and they must
establish a pattern of working on experiments together that are psychologically
safe. Approaches such as DevOps, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, and Agile are
all approaches that implicitly gain from a collaborative gaming mindset.

> Who wins in a collaborative game?
