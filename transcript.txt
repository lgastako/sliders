what would happen if we thought of
innovation as a collaborative game
have you ever played on a seesaw
when two players of a similar size agree
to use it with each other in mind
both of them benefit from playing
the seesaw is a collaborative game
while competitive games are fun and have
clear winners and losers
a collaborative game is where all the
players win
by keeping each other's interests in
mind
innovation as a collaborative game is a
way of working that is illustrated by
trisha ratliff in a guidebook by the
same name
the goal of a collaborative game is to
reduce emphasis on competition
and increase emphasis on the dynamic of
play that leads all players to
benefiting
in her book trisha proposes that we
identify three key players the user
creator and investor
all working directly together
the product user this is the person with
a challenge they are motivated to solve
they are willing to give feedback or
engage with the investors and creators
as they work to solve the challenge
for example the user may define the
problem and provide honest assessments
along the way of how well the solution
options are working
the investor
someone who controls the money and are
willing to spend it because they expect
some resulting benefit
this player may be the user themselves
an entrepreneur an executive
philanthropist or anyone who owns the
return on investment
the creator this is someone who designs
develops and delivers the solution
they have the skills and resources to
design build and test new options
most importantly they leverage feedback
from experiments to continuously improve
key players need each other so how do we
set ourselves up to succeed in a
collaborative game
we start by deeply understanding the
hopes and the needs of each of the key
players so they can all win
we also empathize with the concerns they
have if they don't all succeed
we create a collective understanding of
the key players desires concerns and
values for trade-off decisions
this builds trust and collaboration as
everyone takes the needed risk to
experiment with new solutions
key players need to establish a pattern
of working on experiments together that
are psychologically safe because they
assure shared winds and remove
impediments for each other along the way
once we identify a value system for
decision making we can agree to the
rules of play or how the key players
will interact as they try to solve the
challenge
devops lean startup design thinking
agile and other methods are all
approaches that implicitly gain from a
collaborative gaming mindset
these approaches engage in a cycle of
interdependent activities that work
together
they all include essential elements that
can be thought of as rules of play
when they are done well they can become
patterns of connected practices and
values that work in concert as a
collaborative game
[Music]
for over two decades trisha has tested
these thought patterns in a variety of
organizations
large small public and private to find
typical rules of play that achieve
results
over time she noticed when three player
groups work directly together they are
more likely to succeed
this is because they can listen and
support each other's wins
for example an investor may need to
generate a profit from the effort and is
concerned that if it takes too long or
doesn't satisfy the user a competitor
will take away their opportunity and
they will lose
the users well-being may depend on the
solution
so they worry that the investor or
creator will care more about someone
else's problem over their own
the creator may be inspired by the
opportunity to make a difference for the
user and need job security from the
investor
but they may also feel afraid of
delivering something they are not proud
of if the game fails
this pattern of direct collaboration can
break down in large organizations
just like on a seesaw if one of the
players isn't benefiting the game breaks
down or one of the players will leave
and it ends
in a world where customers have many
other choices this is not the scenario
we want
so the need to retain the essence of the
collaborative game has become a
competitive advantage and a fast
changing world

product innovation effort up for mutual
success
